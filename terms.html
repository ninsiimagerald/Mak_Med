            <h2>Definition of terms</h2>
            <p>A Mastermind refers to a user who reads, understands, and then accepts to register and open up an account with Tusome Foundation, under the Mastermind program. Mastermind account refers to the relationship between a user (a Mastermind) and Tusome FOundation, and will be deemed active from the time of signing up onwards. Unless the user decides to close the account, this relationship will always hold true. If violated, either of the partners has the right to sue or be sued in the courts of law, according as the terms of mastermind program are concerned. Challenge refers to a contest onto which different Masterminds compete with the aim of acqusition of knowledge.</p>

            <li>Tusome Foundation recognises any individual who registers with Mastermind program as a Mastermind, and therefore subject to its terms. However, Tusome Foundation has the right to hold, close, or ban any Mastermind from accessing its services if the latter infringes on the terms of the foundation.</li>
            <li>Every Mastermind has the right to read the content that is published publicly as long as they have fulfilled the fare for which the author of the work has put. However the reader has no right to reproduce (by printing, copying, or selling) the work they read, but can use the knowledge acquired to teach others.</li>
            <li>Every Mastermind who wishes to publish his/her work will have to first meet the Mastermind qualification policy.</li>
            <li>Tusome Foundation will have the rights on every published work in the Mastermind program to use, distribute, or sell it with or without knowledge from the author. This agreement acts as a consent to confirm that the author accepts this practice.</li>
            <li>Tusome Foundation has no right of accessing your payment account detailss. All payments will be made through proprietory third party institutions but not on this website.</li>
            <li>Every content published will first be reviewed and approved to be true according to the standards of the curriculum.</li>
            <li>On publishing, the Mastermind can choose between fast and normal publishing. Normal publishing may take between one to seven days of approval; but fast publishing takes between five minutes to six hours of approval. This process is to allow for approving of the content shared and making sure the work is standard.</li>
