        <h1><big>Anticonvulsants</big></h1>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Seizures are sudden attacks of involuntary muscular contractions and relaxations which are electrically mediated from the CNS due to the change in normal firing of the neurons.
Seizure can result due to high concentrations of the excitatory neurotransmitters (Glutamate and Aspartate) or low concentrations of inhibitory neurotransmitters (GABA).</p>
<h1>Etiology of seizures</h1>
<p>
Ions involved are Na+ (influx causes presynaptic excitation) K+ (efflux causes postsynaptic inhibition), Cl- (influx causes postsynaptic inhibition) and Ca++ (influx causes postsynaptic excitation).
Thus, treatment strategy is targeted at blocking actions of glutamate NT (also including blockage of Na+ channels), enhancing actions of GABA (which causes influx of Cl-), blocking of K+ channels (that inhibits efflux of K+ channels) and blockage of Ca++ (which inhibits influx of Ca++).</p>
<h1>Drug targets</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Synthesis of GABA</h3>
<p>From its precursor, Glutamate, by Glutamate Decarboxylase (GAD). Inhibited by Pregabalin and Valproate.</p>
</li>
<li><h3>Effect of GABA</h3>
<p>GABA enhances Cl- channel opening, and influx of Cl- causes hyperpolarization (inhibitory effect). This is targeted by three types of drugs: Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, and GABA analogs, and they all have an agonist action on the GABA-A receptor.</p></li>
<li><h3>Uptake of GABA</h3><p>By the GABA transporter; which is inhibited by Tiagabine.</p></li>
<li><h3>GABA metabolism</h3><p>To its metabolites by GABA transaminase (GABA-T) which is inhibited by valproate and vigabatrin.</p></li>
<li><h3>Effect of Glutamate</h3><p>Binding to the NMDA receptor causes excitation of postsynaptic neurons, antagonized by Lamotrigene and Felbamate.</p></li>
<li><h3>Role of Sodium</h3><p>Entry of Na+ causes depolarization of presynaptic neurons which causes release of excitatory NT like glutamate. Na+ channel is blocked by phenytoin and carbamazepine, valproate, topiramate, and zonisamide.</p></li>
<li><h3>Role of Calcium</h3><p>Entry of Ca++ in the postsynaptic neuron cause propagation of an action potential. Ethosuximide and valproate increase the threshold of Ca++ spikes thus reducing the Ca++ currents.</p></li></ol>

<h1>Classification</h1>
<p>Classification depends on;</p>
<h2>Mechanism of action</h2>
<h3>Effect on GABA</h3>
Valproate, Zonisamide, Topiramate, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Vigabatrin, Tiagabine, Pregabalin, Levetiracetem, Gabapentin
<h3>Effect on Na+</h3>
Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Lamotrigine, Oxcarbazepine, Felbamate, Topiramate, Valproate, Zonisamide
<h3>Effect on Ca++</h3>
Valproate, Zonisamide, Pregabalin, Levetiracetam, Gabapentin, Ethosuximide
<h2>Chemical classification</h2>
<ul>
<li>Carboxamides – carbamazepine</li>
<li>Hydantoins – phenytoin</li>
<li>Barbiturates – phenobarbital</li>
<li>Succinimides – ethosuximide</li>
<li>Valproates – sodium valproate</li>
<li>Benzodiazepines – clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam</li>
<li>GABA analogues – gabapentin and tiagabine</li>
<li>Heterogenic compounds – lamotrigine, levetiracetam, pregabalin, topiramate, vigabatrin</li>
</ul>

<h2>Effect on CYP450 enzymes</h2>
<h3>Inducers</h3><p>Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital
These increase clearance, and thus decrease the effect of OCOs, warfarin, and theophylline.</p>
<h3>Inhibitors</h3><p>Valproate
These decrease clearance, and thus increase the effect of the affected drugs</p>




<h1>Drug properties</h1>
<h2>CBMZ</h2>
<ul>
<li>Metabolite is neurotoxic and has higher anticonvulsant properties.</li>
<li>Causes agranulocytosis.</li>
<li>DOC for trigeminal neuralgia. </li>
<li>Backup drug for bipolar disorders (after lithium).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Phenytoin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Has saturable metabolic system, and gets saturated when drug concentrations are high, causing toxicity.</li>
<li>Has variable absorption</li>
<li>Has a very high protein binding capacity</li>
<li>Has dose dependent elimination curve (shifts from 1st order to zero order at high doses).</li>
<li>Never used in absence seizures.</li>
<li>Toxicity is best remembered by HOTMALIKA: Hyperplasia of gingivae, Osteomalacia, Teratogenic, Megaloblastic anemia, Ataxia,</li>
<li>Lymphadenopathy, Insulin release inhibition, Vitamin K deficiency, Arrhythmias.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gabapentin</h2>
<p>In combination with CBMZ; used for treatment of shooting and stabbing neuropathic pain which responds poorly to analgesics.</p>
<h2>Topiramate</h2>
<p>Is associated with myopia and closed angle glaucoma</p>
<h2>Phenobarbital</h2> 
<ul>
<li>More sedative</li>
<li>Withdraw symptoms precipitate status epilepticus</li>
</ul>

<h2>SECTION C</h2>
<p>
    A 45-year-old female who has been experiencing partial seizures has come to her neurologist for a review. While describing her recent symptoms, the neurologist notices that her heart may have started experiencing problems, and he refers her to the cardiologist. In the heart clinic, she confirms that these ‘abnormal heart beats’ had never been there, until a time she went to a local clinic with a problem of bloating, and delayed stomach emptying. The nurse had given her a macrolide, X, and she explained to her that the stomach emptying would be increased. When it became a habit, she kept taking this drug X to relive her stomach problems. The cardiologist also confirms that drug X is related to her heart problems. She was given drug Y, which after confirming from her neurologist, told her that her seizure problems would also be improved.
