    <h1>ABOUT MASTERMIND</h1>
    <div class="about_content">

        <h2>Why the Masterminds?</h2>
        <p>Because everyone is a mastermind at something. And when those masterminds meet, a solution to the problem is
            birthed.</p>
        <h2>And what is the problem?</h2>
        <p>Learning has always been our life. We learn new environments, languages, skills, and most importantly, we
            learn new specialities. Like the medical speciality.
            Learning Medicine needs many skills including the acquisition of knowledge and how to apply it. Learning it
            alone would not only be hard, but would also seem like unenjoyable.</p>
        <h2>So what?</h2>
        <p>Which is why, The Mastermind. Share your stories, summaries, mnemonics, and quizzes about a topic, as you
            also read the problems that other people have encountered, and their best solutions on those problems.
            Registration is free of charge. And the good thing is:
            You can sell your work across the globe so that your hard work is rewarded.</p>
        <h2>How do I know this work is authentic?</h2>
        <p>As a profession, we value uprightness of the information we share among ourselves. Thus, a team of medical
            professionals always reviews the work before it is approved to be available publicly. As you read though, if
            you are a premium member, you have a chance to comment on the unreviewed or unapproved work so you connect
            with the writers and also sharpen each other. However, if the writer submits his work for review, he agrees
            to our POLICY AND TERMS so that his work is reviewed by experts.</p>
        <h2>Are you a teacher?</h2>
        <p>Register with us to help in editing of content to make sure that our Masterminds are not corrupted.
            Experts review the work and approve it within a weeks period within which they exchange drafts with the
            writer in case it is not up to date so they work on it.</p>
        <h2>Why is it important for my work to be reviewed?</h2>
        <p>It is necessary, as many readers come to read or buy work from the Masterminds, that this work is indeed up
            to date and worth reading. Thus, before publishing your work for sale, it must be reviewed by the experts,
            who go by the standards of renown medical schools and by WHO.
            As a reader, before trusting or buying any work, ensure that it has been reviewed and approved. This will be
            showed by a blue badge of approval and with the name of the person who reviewed it.
            Why wait?
            Let the future begin.</p>
